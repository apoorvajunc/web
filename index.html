	            <h4> Timing of Migration, Immigrant Quality and Labor Market Assimilation: Evidence from a Long Panel in Germany </h4>
	            <p>
	This paper shows that it is important to account for the timing of migration while estimating immigrants' rate of economic assimilation. The length of stay in the host country, which is commonly assumed to be exogenous in existing literature, depends on the timing of migration. As the optimum timing of migration is based on net expected lifetime earnings, the length of stay is also endogenously determined. In this paper, the timing of migration and wage assimilation equations have been modeled and estimated jointly, which is a first in the literature. Using German Socio-Economic Panel data from 1984 to 2014, the paper estimates the individual-specific rate of assimilation while accounting for unobserved immigrant quality and unobserved propensity of early migration. Estimates from the joint model reveal four key findings. First, the average rate of assimilation estimated under the exogeneity assumption is biased upwards. Second, the average rate of assimilation hides significant variation in assimilation rates between immigrants of different quality. Third, immigrants of low quality have a faster rate of assimilation than their high quality counterparts. Fourth, immigrants with a high propensity of early migration have a higher individual-specific rate of assimilation. The joint model allows us to find the interdependence between the timing of migration and labor market assimilation of immigrants, mechanisms that up until now had been assumed to be independent in literature. </p>
	 
	            <h4> Wage Divergence: Why Does the Gap between Natives and Immigrants Get Bigger? </h4>
	            <p>
	This study finds strong empirical evidence of wage divergence between immigrants and natives over their life cycle in Germany using the country-wide household panel from 1984 to 2014. In order to analyze this empirical evidence, we incorporate the possibility of wage divergence into the standard two-period model of economic assimilation by modeling the differences in the technology of human capital production and prices per unit of human capital between immigrants and natives.  The paper derives and estimates the empirical model of wage convergence using the average 5-year growth in absolute and relative wage as a dependent variable. The individual rates of wage convergence are found to be positively associated with the increase in per capita GDP in the country of origin, GDP growth in the host country, linguistic distance, and the share of immigrants’ old networks, among other convergence factors. We differentiate between pre- and post-migration education and job training and use supply shifters in government-sponsored training programs to instrument for endogenous post-migration human capital.  Immigrants’ rates of wage convergence increase with higher pre-migration formal schooling and post-migration job training, but they appear not affected by formal schooling in the host country.  The paper also addresses the commonly ignored sample selection issue due to non-random survey attrition and employment participation. </p>
	 
	            <h4> Old Questions, New Country: Labor Market Assimilation of Immigrants in Russia. </h4>
	            <p>
	The paper revisits the questions of labor market assimilation of immigrants but for an unexplored country, Russia. I use immigrant data in Russian Longitudinal Monitored Survey from 1994-2011 and estimate the individual rates of economic assimilation using the joint model of timing of migration and wage assimilation. The Russian Federation has one of the largest stocks of immigrants in the world and has a unique composition of immigrant population. Russia experienced an influx of immigrants after the break-up of the Soviet Union and still receives a large number of immigrants from former Soviet states. These immigrants, for the most part, are linguistically, ethnically, and culturally similar to the natives. Interestingly, the results are similar to those estimated for Germany (in a supplementary paper) despite the different mix of migrants and different migration policies. Again, the individual rates of assimilation vary significantly and they are inversely correlated with the immigrant quality. These results provide external validity to the findings on immigrant assimilation in Germany.  </p>
